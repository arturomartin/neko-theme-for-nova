A minimal dark theme for [Nova](https://nova.app), the new editor by [Panic](https://panic.com/). I created for myself and use it for my daily work. Use it as you like!

Inspired by the beautiful [Ayu](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu) and [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) themes.

## Installation

- On Nova, go to `Extensions > Extensions Library > Themes` and install Neko from there.
- After that, go to `Nova > Preferences > Theme` and choose Neko.
